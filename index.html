<h1>The Age of Steel</h1>
<p>You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!</p>
<h2>The Sontaran Stratagem</h2>
<p>You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. You hit me with a cricket bat. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!</p>
<ul>
<li>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.&hellip;hey.&hellip;the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</li>
<li>You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!</li>
<li>Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Shakespeare Code</h3>
<p>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.</p>
<h4>Smith and Jones</h4>
<p>You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! No&hellip; It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<ol>
<li>Did I mention we have comfy chairs?</li>
<li>No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</li>
<li>Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Doctor's Daughter</h5>
<p>It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</p>
<h6>Day of the Moon</h6>
<p>Did I mention we have comfy chairs? They're not aliens, they're Earth&hellip;liens! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.</p>
<p>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! You hit me with a cricket bat.</p>

I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</p>
